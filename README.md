# Blog Engine
For this project, I built a blog website that contains some features for users including:
* Register tab: User can create an account that has first name, last name, email address, password and role
* Login tab: User can log in to an account based on email address and password
* Index tab: It lists all the Blog Posts created including title, contentas a preview. User enter the link to see the full blog post
* Display full blog post tab: It shows the title, content, posted value, email address and full name of the users who created the post. If the user is logged in, they should be able to comment on the blog post. When a user posts a comment, it should be scanned for Bad Words listed in the Bad Words tab in database. If a word is found, replace that word content with *****
* Add blog post tab: User can create a blog post including title, content, posted (date time)
* Edit blog post tab: It allows an administrator to modify of a selected blog post
* Bad Words tab: Allows an administrator to define a set of restricted words that will be starred - out when a use posts a comment. The administrator should be able to delte bad words
